== Day 01 - Calorie Counting ==

The day was lines representing the calories of food items carried by elves and separated by blank lines.
Kotlin File has a readLines function that makes it easy to parse the input, calculate the calories for each elf and add to a list.
For part one the max value it the answer.

[source,kotlin]
....
include::src/solution.kt[tag=part1]
....

For part two the result is the sum of the first three when sorted in descending order. Kotlin has the `take` method on collections which is very useful in this case.
