== Day 1: Calorie Counting ==

https://rust-lang.org[Rust] solution to https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1[AoC|2022|1].

Nothing very interesting today.

=== Input ===

Parse everything in a vec of sums (initially I used a vec of vecs; since individual elements are never needed sums are enough)

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=input]

=== Star 1 ===

Just find the biggest sum (I use `fold` instead of `max` to not handle the `Option::None` case)

----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=star_1]
----

=== Star 2 ===

Sum the three biggest sums. First solution used `Vec::sort`. New solution does not use any sorting and should be `O(n)`.

=== Tests ===

No tests today. It was too simple.

=== Today I learned ===

Not so much. My template works.

Iterating/refactoring the solution, I learned that `std::iter::Sum` has an implementation `impl<T, U, E> Sum<Result<U, E>> for Result<T, E>`.
