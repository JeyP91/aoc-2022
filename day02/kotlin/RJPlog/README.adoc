==  Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors  ==

This solution is written in Kotlin.

The original puzzle can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2


=== First Star

How does it work: +

Inside function _rockPaperScissors_ the puzzle input is read line by line. With a simple _when_ construct for each game the result is added to a final result.
[source, kotlin, numbered]
....
include::day2202_1_2.kt[tags=RPS]
....


=== Second Star

How does it work: +

The same function call is used only with a different input parameter and therefore a second _when_ construct is taking care for adding up the correct scores of each game.


At the end, both solutions are printed out. 
[source, kotlin, numbered]
....
include::day2202_1_2.kt[tags=output]
