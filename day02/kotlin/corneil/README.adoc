== Day 02 - Rock Paper Scissors

Part 1 meant we needed to parse input representing an opponent hand when playing RPS, and we had to assume the 2nd input was an answer we needed to provide while "cheating".

Part 2 came with a curveball in that the 2nd input should be treated as an outcome. This means we needed to find the correct hand for the outcome.
The score calculation was a function of the outcome and the hand we selected.

Below is the final code and there are loaders for creating the rounds for part 1 and part 2.
