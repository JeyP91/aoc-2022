== What I learned

. This one was again straightforward.

== Approach

I just put the inputs into a list.
For each star created a dictionary with the scores based on the rules described.
Since there are only 9 cases each time, I didn't write code for this but just entered them per hand into the dictionary.
Then, you feed the list into the dictionary and sum the result.

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
