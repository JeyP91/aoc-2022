
Day 3 of year 2022
https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3

== What I learned

. I used `ord` for the first time.

== Approach
I put all of the rucksacks in a list.

**Star 1** +
I just took each letter from the first half of each rucksack and check if it is present in the second half. If so,
it's the duplicate and I go to the next rucksack.
To get the priorities, I used ord and did the math.

**Star 2** +
It's similar. I take each letter from the first rucksack and see if it is in both of the next
2 rucksacks. If so, it's the badge and I skip to the next 3 rucksacks.

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
