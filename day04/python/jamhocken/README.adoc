== What I learned

. Remembered more or less how to use regex again.

== Approach
I use a regex to fish out the 4 numbers on each line and put them into a list of lists.

**Star 1** +
I just checked if the first pair is contained in the second or vice versa and put a 1 in a list if true. Then you just sum that list.

**Star 2** +
It's similar. You just check essentially that the 2 pairs are not disjoint. If so, put a 1 in the list. Sum the list.

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
