== Day 04 ==

Both problems are identical today, just the condition for summing is different.

- First convert the string into an array of string slices.
- Convert the slices to int, expecting 4 of them. (it will panic on unwrap if we don't have 4)
- Apply the condition of the problem, return 1 for success
- Sum
