== Tuning Trouble

Today was probably the easiest one so far from my perspective. We had to write a simple parser to find the first unique sequence of characters with a given length and report the number of characters read.

The Kotlin collections method `windowed` provides a way to create a window over an `Iterable` and provides a simple way to solve this. Checking that the content of the window as a unique set is the same size as the window.

=== Solution
[source,kotlin]
....
fun findUniquePacketEnd(input: String, packetSize: Int): Int {
  return input.toList()
    .windowed(packetSize)
    .indexOfFirst { it.toSet().size == packetSize } + packetSize
}
....
