== Tuning Trouble

Today was probably the easiest one so far from my perspective. We had to write a simple parser to find the first unique sequence of characters with a given length and report the number of characters read.

I decided to treat the input and current packet as a list of characters instead of a string.

=== Solution
[source,kotlin]
....
fun findPacketStart(input: String, packetSize: Int): Int {
  val data = input.toList()
  val packet = mutableListOf<Char>()

  for (index in data.indices) {
    packet.add(data[index])
    if (packet.size > packetSize) {
      packet.removeAt(0)
    }
    if (packet.size == packetSize && packet.toSet().size == packetSize) {
      return index + 1
    }
  }
  return input.length
}
....
