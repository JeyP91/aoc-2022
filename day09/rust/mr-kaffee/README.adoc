== Day 9: Rope Bridge ==

https://rust-lang.org[Rust] solution to https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/9[AoC|2022|9].

Knots are moving around, following each other. The difficulty is to figure out where you have your off by one errors or similar. In the end, I had a print function showing current configurations to debug my code:

=== Input ===

I parse the input in a vec of tuples '((dx, dy), s)' where `dx` and `dy` are the horizontal / vertical unit step changes and `s` is the number of steps.

Not allocating extra memory for today's input parsing is not for me ;)

=== Solution ===

After a little bit of refactoring, one solution works for both parts today. The solve function is called with the total number of knots (including head) as a parameter. 

In each step, it updates the head and than calls the update function which updates all subsequent knots ony by one.

=== Today I learned ===

That sometimes it is helpful to write `as _` to give the rust compiler a hint to perform type coercion. Although in the end, I did not use it in my solution.

And, today for the first time, I used my scripted solution to submit results. Not because it is faster (who cares about a few seconds) but because it is fun.
