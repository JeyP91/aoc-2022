== Day 10: Cathode-Ray Tube ==

https://rust-lang.org[Rust] solution to https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/10[AoC|2022|10].

Today is about a simple CPU which is used to control a simple display (a cathode-ray tube)

=== Input ===

Parsing the input is straight forward. Each line represents either an `addx` operation or a `noop` operation

=== Star 1 ===

I created a small model of the CPU:

The most difficult part was to read the puzzle description carefully. Specifically the part were it says to calculate the signal strength *during* and not *after* the 20th, 60th, ... cycle.

The rest was just applying the instructions giving in the puzzle.

=== Star 2 ===

Again, reading carefully is important. I did not get the meaning of

In this system, there is no such thing as "vertical position"

After having that fixed, it was again straight forward.

=== Tests ===

A bit of tests, as usual ...
