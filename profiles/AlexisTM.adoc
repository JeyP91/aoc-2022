=== About me

I am a Robotics Engineer working mainly in C++, Python & Javascript.

I started the AoC 2021 in https://codewithrockstar.com/online[RockStar] but didn't have the bravery to go all the way through it.

Today, I want to learn Rust so created few projects and will do this AoC with it. This would definitely have avoided https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-22:15.ping.asc[Ping CVE in FreeBSD].

To start up with rust, you can install the toolchain with https://rustup.rs/[Rustup], then compile & run with:

```rust
cargo run --release
```
